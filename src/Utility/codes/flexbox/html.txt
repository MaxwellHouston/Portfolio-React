                    <p>Mold in your home or work can be a terrifing prospect. Luckily at MAXX Property Restoration
                        we have the best mold experts in the region. They will come out and asses the air quality,
                        take smaples, and determine the health risks. Then our remediation team will set up proper
                        containment barriers and use state of the art technology and machines to assure no spores
                        will spread outside the work area while we remediate the area. Once done we preform another
                        air quality check to make sure it was done right.
